            <h2>Elephant</h2>
            <p>Elephants are the largest living land animals. Three living
                species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant
                (Loxodonta africana), the African forest elephant (L. cyclotis),
                and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). They are the only
                surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order
                Proboscidea; extinct relatives include mammoths and mastodons.
                Distinctive features of elephants include a long proboscis
                called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and
                tough but sensitive grey skin.</p>

            <h2>zebra</h2>
            <p>A zebra is a wild African animal known for its distinctive black
                and white striped coat. There are three species of zebra: the
                plains zebra, the mountain zebra, and Grevy's zebra. They are
                all members of the horse family, Equidae. Zebras are primarily
                found in various African habitats, including savannas,
                grasslands, and mountainous regions. </p>

            <h2>Kenguru</h2>
            <p>"Kenguru" can refer to two distinct things: a
                wheelchair-accessible electric vehicle and street
                workout/calisthenics equipment. The term itself is Hungarian for
                "kangaroo". </p>
